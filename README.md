# Scientific Computing
In this repository, the physics problem are solved by numerical algorithm. The problems are as follows:
1. Radioactive Decay
2. Ballistic motion
3. Harmonic motion
4. Chaos
5. Root finding and integration
6. Random Walk
7. Cluster growth and percolation
8. Ising model for ferro-magnetism
